# Drone hijacking using Arduino and HackRF One

The contest goal is to take control over a drone. 

* drone control range: 2.4 GHz ISM,
* control is driven by the module nRF24L01+ 

This project describes 3 ways to take control over a drone:

* using SDR
* using Arduino and nRF24L01+
* replay attack using Universal Radio Hacker and HackRF One
